Helpful scripts for Doc Films board members 

Currently this repo contains:

1. capsules.py: re-formats capsules spreadsheet (in tsv form) into listings for UChicago Arts and generates series pages for our website. Note: Series titles, programmers, and descriptions must still be manually added. An example input file with one week's worth of screenings is also provided.
