Pigskin Parade	460	Andrew McVea	Madison	yes		Hadi	yes		David Butler	1936	When Garland first signed to MGM at age 13, executives weren’t sure what to do with her. Too old to be a child star and too young for most adult parts, she was often cast as the sibling or friend of the male lead. That's the case in Garland's feature film debut, a musical comedy in which she plays the sister of an Arkansas native scouted to play college football. Fortunately, despite this, Garland takes several opportunities to show off her stunning voice.	93	35mm	9/26/2016	7:00 PM							9/26/2016 19:00:00	9/26/2016 20:33:00	93	9/26/2016 0:00:00	9/26/2016 1:33:00	9/26/2016 0:00:00	9/26/2016 1:33:00	12/30/1899 0:00:00	12/30/1899 1:33:00	26
